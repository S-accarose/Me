## Hi, good see uu.
My name is Luiz Ot√°vio, but also known as Saccarose (specially between my friends group). I'm an autistic Brazilian guy who loves videogames, art of any kind (i'm also an artist) and coding. Still newbie at coding but i'm loving the process of learning new stuff and practicing. Here's where i'll post whatever i'll be doing during my studies. Fell free to take a look, i won't bite lol
